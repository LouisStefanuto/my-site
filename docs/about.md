Hello! I am **Louis Stefanuto**, I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence and dealing with (big) data. I work as a **ML Engineer** at [**Capgemini Invent**](https://www.capgemini.com/about-us/who-we-are/our-brands/capgemini-invent/).

I completed my engineering studies at École [**Polytechnique**](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien) (Cycle Grandes Ecoles), specializing in Machine Learning and Mechanics. Additionally, I hold a dual degree "Ingénieur Civil" from **Mines Paris**, with a focus on AI Systems.

My core interests lie at the intersection of AI and sciences, particularly in biology and fundamental science. I’m fascinated by how machine learning can decode the complexities of life, accelerate scientific breakthroughs, and transform our understanding of the world.
